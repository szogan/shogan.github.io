                <p>Lobster is a new communication app, created out of a need for change in a world dominated by Discord.
                    It was born as a response to growing user frustration — tired of clunky interfaces, unnecessary features, and policies that increasingly ignore privacy and people’s real needs. Lobster is designed to be simple, lightweight, and instantly accessible — no account, no extra settings. Want to talk? Just join and start typing.
                    It’s a space for those who value freedom, privacy, and the absence of corporate oversight in everyday communication.</p>

                <p> Purifier is a new kind of energy drink – clean, refreshing, and made to break the norm.
                    While most energy drinks lean into gritty, loud aesthetics, Purifier does the opposite. It's light, crisp, and focused on clarity — in taste, design, and effect.
                    With a wide range of unique flavors and a price that's easy on the wallet, it's built for global reach without losing its core idea: energy should feel clean.</p>

                <a>Synergy as a story</a>
                <p> Synergy is a tale of friendship, loss, and the weight of choice.
                In a world that has never known magic, reality begins to collapse — rifts open, devouring people and places, leaving nothing behind. Vanos, a weary and broken teenager, along with a group of close friends, is dragged into a new reality filled with ruins, strange beings, and echoes of forgotten lives. Each of his companions loses their memory, and Vanos — torn between guilt and the will to protect them — must rebuild those bonds and remind them of who they truly are.
                Guiding him is Alloy — a soul that fuses with his body. At first, she appears as a caring guide, but her true intentions are darker: she craves vengeance, nudging Vanos toward violence. The story constantly teeters between tragedy and hope, and every choice opens different paths, shaping the outcome. It’s ultimately a story of whether one can preserve their identity when the world itself is consumed by darkness.</p>

                <a>Synergy as a game</a>
                <p>Synergy is a journey through a dying world where every choice carries weight, and battles are not just fought with weapons but with the essence of the soul; three companions wield their fate through unfolding cards that become living visions of attack or defense, while enemies strike back with storms of light and shadow the player must evade; the path moves ever forward through ruins, forgotten villages, collapsing castles and eerie corridors, with only rare side routes hiding secrets or strange figures; each soul burns with a different color — hope, wrath, regret, curiosity — shaping not only combat but the very dialogue that defines the story; in the end, the greatest enemy is not the monsters of this realm but another Vanos, a tyrant who refused death and hoarded the power of the original, forcing the player to confront not only the world but the reflection of what they themselves might become.</p>

                <a>Eremphobia</a>
                <p>Eremphobia was a game that never came to life — envisioned as a haunting mix of Cry of Fear and the endless terror of the Backrooms. The player would step into the mind of Michael, a man broken by family struggles and mental illness, whose hallucinations twisted the world around him into grotesque monsters. His only desire was escape, chasing whispers from the dark web about a forbidden passage that led into the labyrinth where no one returns. Designed as a retro-styled PS1 horror, drenched in atmosphere, puzzles, and dread, it promised a descent into both psychological torment and otherworldly fear. But like its own collapsing corridors, the project fell apart under the weight of development troubles, leaving only fragments of what could have been.</p>
